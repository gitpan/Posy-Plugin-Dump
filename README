==== NAME ====

Posy::Plugin::Dump - Posy plugin to aid debugging by dumping object contents


==== VERSION ====

This describes version ``0.40'' of Posy::Plugin::Dump.


==== DESCRIPTION ====

This plugin is for developers to aid debugging by "dumping" the contents of
$self and the "state" hashes to STDERR when it is called. Provides a 'dump'
method which can be put as an action into the actions list or into the
entry_actions list (or both).


==   Activation   ==

This plugin needs to be added to both the plugins list and the actions list.
It doesn't really matter where it is in the plugins list.

In the (entry_)actions list, it goes whereever you want it to go.
